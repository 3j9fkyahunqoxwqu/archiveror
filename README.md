# Archiveror

Archiveror is a browser extension that will help you archive webpages by
submitting them to <https://archive.today>. It will automatically archive every
page you bookmark so you will always be able to revisit it on a later time as
you first found it, whether or not the content has changed or even disappeared.
If you revisit an already archived bookmark, Archiveror's icon will change and
clicking on it will open the page on the archive. Previously bookmarked pages
will be archived after you visit them again with Archiveror enabled.

In addition you can also archive the current page by clicking the icon. This
will put the archive link in your clipboard (Firefox only), ready to be pasted
(Control+V). There's also a hotkey for this, Control+Y, which can be changed at
the preferences.

Happy archiving!

*Privacy note*: this extension will necessarily send your bookmarks to
<https://archive.today>.
