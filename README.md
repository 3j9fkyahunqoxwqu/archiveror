# Archiveror

Archiveror is a browser extension that will help you archive webpages by
submitting them to <https://archive.is> (formerly <https://archive.today>). It
will automatically archive every page you bookmark so you will always be able to
revisit it on a later time as you first found it, whether or not the content has
changed or even disappeared. If you revisit an already archived bookmark,
Archiveror's icon will change and clicking on it will open the page on the
archive. Previously bookmarked pages will be archived after you visit them again
with Archiveror enabled.

In addition you can also archive the current page by clicking the icon. This
will put the archive link in your clipboard (Firefox only), ready to be pasted.
There's also a hotkey for this, Alt+Y, which can be changed at the preferences.

Happy archiving!

*Privacy note*: this extension will necessarily send your bookmarks to
<https://archive.is>.

## Local Saving
(Currently for Chrome only)

Archiveror can also make local copies of webpages. One page will be saved in a
single [MHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML) file. Bookmarks will be
automatically saved in your Downloads directory, organized just like your
bookmarks. Pages can also be manually saved by either clicking the button or
pressing Ctrl+Shift+S.

To enable local archiving mode, right click the Archiveror button, go to the
options and then pick "Local".
