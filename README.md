# Archiveror

Archiveror is a browser extension for Firefox that will help you archive
webpages by submitting them to <https://archive.today>. It will automatically
archive every page you bookmark so you will always be able to revisit it on a
later time as you first found it, whether or not the content has changed or even
disappeared. If you revisit an already archived bookmark, Archiveror's icon will
change and clicking on it will open the page on the archive. Previously
bookmarked pages will be archived after you visit them again with Archiveror
enabled.

In addition you can also archive the current page by clicking the icon. This
will put the archive link in your clipboard, ready to be pasted (Control+V).
There's also a hotkey for this, Control+Y, which can be changed at the
preferences.

Archiveror can be installed from the
[Firefox Add-ons homepage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archiveror/).

Happy archiving!

*Privacy note*: this extension will necessarily send your bookmarks to
<https://archive.today>.
